  <p>Founded in 2019, Romosexuals started as an 8-man redraft league on ESPN amongst a small group of high school friends. The league decided to make the switch over to Sleeper and to a new commissioner in 2021.</p>
  <p>Under the strict and harsh rule of new commissioner Caleb White, the league has continued to grow and thrive. Adding new managers, new traditions, and a physical Romosexuals Trophy has given all the managers something to latch on to and continue to come back for.</p>
  <p>On top of the bragging rights that come along with walking away from the year as a champion, the winner will receive their name engraved on the Romosexuals Trophy as well as $900 cash.</p>
